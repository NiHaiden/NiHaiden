### Hi there 👋

My name is Niklas Haiden and I am a full time student. 👨‍🎓

Currently, I am an enrolled student at the vocational school HTL St.Pölten in Lower Austria. 

👨‍🔬I love tinkering with different technologies, be it TypeScript, Spring, Kotlin.


🔭I love experimenting with new stuff like Angular, React and all sorts of other things. 
Please don't look into the Labxx Repositories, this is only bad code and only for archival purposes 😅
